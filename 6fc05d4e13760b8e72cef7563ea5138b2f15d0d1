      "message": "The reason for using defer is that by design reactive streams are lazy \u003d they shouldn\u0027t do anything until a subscription is made. Hence you have two options here:\n\n1. Wrap the whole method with single return Mono.defer and return these Mono.just without further wrapping - preferable because is lazy.\n2. Get rid of these `Mono.defer`s if you thing the job to be done (if-logic) is minor overhead and the time of subscription doesn\u0027t matter - will violate laziness but may be justified.",
