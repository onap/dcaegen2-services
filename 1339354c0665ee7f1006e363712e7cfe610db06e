      "message": "Both DB initialization and db_data are almost same between DL-Feeder and DES (see same table create and data load in few instances). Can you clarify whats the need to have this included redundant among these 2 services?",

      "message": "If these 2 have different schema (\u0027bit\u0027 in DES and \u0027boolean\u0027 in DL-feeder) might cause some confusions/errors as they use the same table and DB so I thought I keep them the same and DES does use the table \u0027db_type\u0027 in the code but not sure if there is any API that is using it.\n\nIf you ask why the other tables and data are redundant I\u0027m not sure maybe @Kai can clarify. I did think of removing the unused tables but it wouldn\u0027t come within the scope of non-root access so I let them be.",
